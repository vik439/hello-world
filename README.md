Posting my contents to Github
Hello Friends, although I have been with programming since 12 years and was actively coding in several platforms like PHP, Javascripts, JQuesry, Bootstrap, I was not active on Git.
Of late I understood the importance of posting my contents on Git, which not only acts as an repository, it will also help me in organising my codes for future reference.
So here I start with Python, which I had been studying for my MTech programme and further would dig into Data Science subjects of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
